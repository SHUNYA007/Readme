#HELP 
Help  is our effort towards creating a application which people can use to communicate when there is no internet.This application is specifically created for disaster struck areas where communication can play a vital role in saving human lives. 
It is a android chatting app which creates a mesh network of mobiles. Mobiles can interact with each other without connecting  to the internet.
Help was created using Kotlin as its base lanuage.
